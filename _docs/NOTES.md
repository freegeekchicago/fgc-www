# Questions
- What dynamic content do we need?
	- Calendar (Google Calendar Embed)
	- Pickup Form (Google Form Embed)
	- Contact Form (Google Form Embed)
	- Comments for Blog Posts (Disqus or Livefyre Embed)
	- Directions / Map (OpenStreets Embed? or Google Maps Embed)
	- Site Search (Google custom search, but there are other options we should look at if needed.


- Host on FGC Webfaction server or on github pages?
	- Webfaction would require either pushing static content to server or installing ruby, bundler, and jekyll on to server
	- Github Pages are more limiting in additional plugins that are supported.
